Building Kalava
---------------

Kalava can be compiled and used on Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD.
We support big endian and little endian architectures.

Kalava has some dependencies, g++, gsoap, cmake and opencv, make sure these 
libraries are installed correctly.

As for installing the Kalava service, it is as simple as:

	% ./install.sh

The script will ask you a few questions and will setup everything you need
to run Kalava properly as a background daemon.

Enjoy!
