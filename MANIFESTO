Kalava Manifesto
================

1 - Memory storage is #1. Memory is fast, and allows our service to have very
    predictable performance.

2 - Fundamental data structures for a fundamental API. Avoid intermediate layers
    in API, so that the complexity is obvious and more complex operations can 
    be performed as the sum of the basic operations.

3 - Code is like a poem; it's not just something we write to reach some practical 
    result but an art of work.

4 - We're against complexity. We believe designing systems is a fight against
    complexity. We'll accept to fight the complexity when it's worthwhile but
    we'll try hard to recognize when a small feature is not worth 1000s of lines
    of code. Most of the time the best way to fight complexity is by not
    creating it at all.

5 - We optimize for joy. We believe writing code is a lot of hard work, and the
    only way it can be worth is by enjoying it. When there is no longer joy in
    writing code, the best thing to do is stop. To prevent this, we'll avoid
    taking paths that will make the service less of a joy to develop.
